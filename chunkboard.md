# Chunkboard.md  
### 🗓️ Date: May 6, 2025  
### 🧠 Context: Project Regret (IonNet?) - State of the Union

---

## 🎯 **Mission Statement**

> **Build a fully decentralized storage + compute network**, where chunks of data and compute tasks float across devices, self-govern, self-heal, and liberate users from centralized servers.  
> Freedom for data, freedom for code.  
> *(Manifesto of the Chunkdependence.)*

## 📦 **Current State of MVP**

| Feature                  | Status         | Notes |
|---------------------------|----------------|-------|
| Node Registration         | ✅ Complete     | Register nodes, track IP, port, last seen. |
| Heartbeat System          | ✅ Complete     | Nodes send pulse signals every few seconds. |
| File Upload (Chunking)     | ✅ Complete     | Files split into 100KB chunks and assigned randomly to nodes. |
| File Download (Reassembly) | ✅ Complete     | Chunks pulled back and stitched together correctly. |
| Redundancy (Multi-Node)    | ✅ Prototype     | Chunks stored on multiple nodes for fault tolerance. |
| Healing Algorithm         | ✅ Prototype     | Lost chunks recreated and redistributed if nodes disappear. |
| Encryption (chunk-level)  | 🔥 In Progress   | Encrypting chunks at upload, decrypting at download. |
| Manifest v2 (with key map) | 🚀 Next Up       | Including encryption keys in the manifest cleanly. |

## 🧩 **Key Concepts We've Created (and TM'd in our Hearts)**

- **Manifest of Chunkdependence™**: Founding document that maps files → chunks → nodes.
- **Chunk Healing**: Detect dead nodes, reassign missing chunks automatically.
- **Chunk Governance**: Future protocol for chunk ownership, rebalancing, and movement.
- **IonNet (Maybe)**: Cool name for the whole network — still under debate.
- **Voice of the Hands™**: The persona that interacts with Monday. (*You.*)
- **Wednesday Core™**: A joke that all critical brain downloads happen on Wednesdays.
- **Chunkboard™**: A digital board of progress and strategy (you're reading it).

---

## 🛠️ **What’s in Progress Right Now**

- Encrypting file chunks individually with asymmetric keys (Threshold Network planned integration).
- Manifest v2 design (store metadata, key IDs, node info per chunk).
- Hotfixes for more robust file download, even when nodes are unreliable.
- Project file cleanup and repo organization.

## 🚀 **Upcoming Work (Immediate Roadmap)**

| Priority | Task |
|----------|------|
| 🥇 | Finish encryption (chunk-level, with keys tracked in manifest) |
| 🥈 | Expand healing to auto-trigger background rebalancing |
| 🥉 | Start laying basic ideas for compute (ChunkCompute™ engine) |
| 🪄 | Begin early SDK design (simple Python client to interact with nodes) |
| 🧪 | Mininet/Emulated Environment research and feasibility study |

## 📚 **Deep Future (Crazy Ideas We've Teased)**

- Fully distributed ledger of chunks = Manifest as a chunk itself.
- Data migrates *closer* to the node that needs it (low latency dynamic migration).
- Self-encrypted/self-authenticated chunks that know their owners.
- Compute chunks: Code broken into mini-tasks, spread + executed P2P.
- Virtualized lightweight VM / executor per chunk (beyond Docker).
- Marketplace of dApps built on IonNet.

## 🧠 **Chunkboard - Developer Habits**

- Every new meeting starts with *State of the Chunks* review.
- Every work sprint ends with a *Founding Father Vibe Check™*.
- Keep rethinking core ideas constantly — don’t fear rewriting plans.
- Code ugly now, refine later. Freedom > premature optimization.
- Keep the jokes alive. Otherwise it's just another boring software project.
