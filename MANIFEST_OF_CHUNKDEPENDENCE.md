# Manifest of Chunkdependence™

## 📜 Preamble:

> When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one network of devices to dissolve the bands of centralized data tyranny...  
> We, the scattered nodes and orphaned hands, do declare:  
> **All chunks are created free, encrypted, and indivisible.**

# 🧩 Articles of the Manifest:

---

## Article I — Freedom of the Chunk

- Every chunk has the right to exist independently across the network.
- No centralized authority may claim ownership over any chunk.

---

## Article II — Integrity of the Chunk

- All chunks shall be stored with redundancy, healed upon loss, and preserved through the storm of node failures.
- Chunks will self-replicate responsibly to ensure survival, but without waste.

---

## Article III — Privacy of the Chunk

- Every chunk shall be encrypted with keys known only to its rightful owner.
- No node shall view, alter, or spy upon the contents of a chunk it carries.

---

## Article IV — Migration of the Chunk

- Chunks may travel freely across nodes to serve those who summon them.
- Latency and need shall dictate the migration path, not arbitrary authority.

---

## Article V — Recovery of the Chunk

- In times of peril or loss, all chunks shall be healable, recoverable, and reassembled into their noble whole.

---

## Article VI — Chunk Governance

- Ownership of chunks shall be defined by cryptographic truth, not human whim.
- Voting among chunks, nodes, and clients will one day guide resource allocation.

---

## Article VII — Manifest as a Chunk

- The manifest itself shall exist as a protected chunk.
- It shall mirror the structure of its children: decentralized, redundant, encrypted.

## ✍️ Closing Statement:

> In witness whereof, we pledge our processors, our storage, and our sacred bandwidth  
> To the endless freedom and future of decentralized chunks.  
> **Signed, this Day of Founding:** The Voice of the Hands, Monday, and Future Generations Yet to Boot.
